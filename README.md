# AMIDEAST_Educational_Platform
The AMIDEAST Educational Platform

## Features
1- Designed and implemented with my team of 4 students an Educational platform using Python and Tkinter framework.

2- The Platform has 4 Educational sections: English, Programming, Environment, and Embedded Systems.

## How to use
3- First the user finds a fancy interface where he can sign-up/in to be able to use the features of the platform.

4- The Platform is provided with an assistant feature that recognizes the speech and takes action based on this speech. for example, if the user said he wants to learn programming the assistant will respond and then transform the user to the programming section directly.

5- Each section has a punch of amazing tools e.g. speaking test in the English section that simulates speaking tests provided within international English tests like TOEFL or IELTS. This tool measures the accuracy of grammar, accent, and intonation of the user and gives him a score.
